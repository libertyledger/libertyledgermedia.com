            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Liberty Ledger Media</strong> exists to strengthen democracy through 
                relentless government accountability. We believe that transparency is not optional—it 
                is the foundation upon which free societies are built.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using cutting-edge artificial intelligence combined with traditional investigative 
                journalism, we monitor government actions 24/7 across the Texarkana region and 
                expose fraud, waste, abuse, and civil rights violations wherever they occur.
            </p>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>1. Transparency</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sunlight is the best disinfectant.</strong> We believe every 
                        government action—every contract, every vote, every dollar spent—should 
                        be accessible to the citizens it affects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our AI-powered systems monitor dozens of government sources continuously, 
                        ensuring that nothing escapes scrutiny. We archive everything, creating 
                        a permanent public record that cannot be erased or rewritten.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What we do:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor 35+ government agenda sources daily</li>
                        <li>Archive all public records for historical reference</li>
                        <li>Publish raw data alongside our reporting</li>
                        <li>Provide FOIA request templates and training</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>2. Investigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Data reveals patterns; journalism reveals truth.</strong> While 
                        our technology identifies red flags, human journalists dig deeper—conducting 
                        interviews, filing FOIA requests, analyzing documents, and holding officials 
                        accountable face-to-face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We pursue stories that matter: no-bid contracts to political allies, civil 
                        rights violations, wasteful spending, conflicts of interest, and systemic 
                        corruption.

                        <li>Cross-reference data across multiple systems</li>
                        <li>Publish thoroughly sourced, legally defensible investigations</li>

                    <p>
                        <strong>An informed citizenry is democracy's first line of defense.</strong> 
                        We don't just report—we educate. Our mission is to empower citizens with 
                        the knowledge and tools to hold their own government accountable.

                    <p>
                        Through workshops, guides, and community engagement, we train citizens 
                        in FOIA requests, civic participation, and watchdog journalism.

            <h2>Our Escalation Ladder</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Liberty Ledger operates on a clear escalation model:</strong> We believe 
                in giving officials the opportunity to do the right thing before exposing wrongdoing 
                publicly. However, we will not be deterred by stonewalling or intimidation.

                        <strong>Monitor</strong> — Our AI systems track government activity 24/7, 
                        flagging items of public interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Research</strong> — When red flags appear, we investigate further: 
                        FOIA requests, document analysis, source interviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Question</strong> — We reach out to officials for comment, giving 
                        them the opportunity to explain their actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Report</strong> — If concerns remain unanswered or explanations 
                        are insufficient, we publish our findings with full documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Follow Up</strong> — We don't drop stories. We continue monitoring 
                        and reporting until accountability is achieved or reform is implemented.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Escalate</strong> — If local accountability fails, we escalate to 
                        state authorities, partner with larger outlets, or involve legal advocacy 
                        organizations.

            <h2>Editorial Rules & Standards</h2>
            
            <h3>Accuracy Above All</h3>
            <p>
                Every claim we publish must be thoroughly sourced and legally defensible. We 
                fact-check aggressively, document meticulously, and correct errors immediately.
            </p>

            <h3>Independence Always</h3>
            <p>
                We accept no government funding, no corporate sponsorships from entities we cover, 
                and no advertising that could compromise our editorial independence. Our loyalty 
                is to truth and the public interest—nothing else.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency in Everything</h3>
            <p>
                We hold ourselves to the same standard we demand of government. Our funding sources, 
                our methodology, our corrections policy—all are public. We archive our own work 
                permanently and make raw data available whenever possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Source Protection</h3>
            <p>
                We use encrypted communications, protect confidential sources, and will never 
                reveal a source's identity without their explicit permission—even under legal 
                pressure.
            </p>

            <h3>Fairness to All</h3>
            <p>
                Every subject of our reporting receives the opportunity to respond before publication. 
                We present opposing viewpoints and allow officials to explain their actions. But 
                fairness does not mean false balance—when the facts are clear, we report them clearly.
            </p>

            <h3>No Sacred Cows</h3>
            <p>
                We hold ALL officials accountable regardless of political party, personal 
                relationships, or pressure from powerful interests. The law applies equally; 
                so does our scrutiny.

                Founder <strong>Brandon Cowan</strong> served two tours in Operation Iraqi Freedom 
                and one in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) as a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman. 
                As a 100% disabled veteran, he has experienced firsthand both the strength of American 
                institutions when they function properly—and the devastating consequences when 
                accountability fails.

            <p>
                Military service teaches that accountability is not optional. When lives are on 
                the line, every decision matters. Every leader is responsible. Every system must 
                function with precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>That same standard should apply to civilian government.</strong> Taxpayer 
                money is sacred. Civil rights are non-negotiable. Transparency is not a courtesy—it 
                is a duty.

                Liberty Ledger exists because Brandon believes that the oath he took to defend 
                the Constitution didn't end when he left the military. It continues in this work: 
                protecting democracy through vigilance, holding power accountable, and ensuring 
                that government serves the people—not the other way around.
